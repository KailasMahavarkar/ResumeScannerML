Swarna SrinivasanData Science, AI-Machine Learning/Deep Learning at Tata Consultancy Services   Swarna managed Akshay directlyAkshay has excellent data crunching and data mining skills. He worked on various data and AI-based projects as a part of my team for over the last couple of years. Most recently, he has worked on creating a predictive hiring engine. He has applied machine learning algorithms to predict future candidate performance based on data points gathered candidates from our digitised hiring process. The engine which was designed and tuned by him, is now capable of predicting future candidate success better than any screening test or interview process conducted by humans.In addition to data skills, Akshay has an incredible work ethic. One can be rest assured that work would be taken to a logical closure if he has taken up the job.Sarang AravamuthanPrincipal Scientist at Ericsson   Sarang was senior to Akshay but didnt manage directlyAkshay and I worked together at Tata Consultancy Services, where I was his supervisor and mentor for a Predictive Data Analytics project.I thoroughly enjoyed my time working with Akshay, and endorse him as a truly valuable asset to any team. He was able to grasp the knowledge I shared on Machine learning algorithms and he also acquired online certifications which show that he is a quick learner, dependable, self-motivated and incredibly hard-working. Beyond that, he is an impressive problem solver who is always able to address complex issues with strategy and confidence. Akshay is inspired by challenges, and never intimidated by them.His knowledge of Python, R, expertise in Machine learning & Data Mining and strong analytical skills was a huge advantage to our group. He put this skill-set to work in building a predictive hiring system and a Similarity Engine with me for TCS Ignite labs.Without a doubt, I confidently recommend Akshay to join any Analytics Company. As a dedicated and knowledgeable employee with a good temperament, I know that he will be an asset to any organization fortunate to have him in their ranks.Akshay TiwariData @ Facebook   Akshay and Akshay were students togetherAkshay has worked as part of my team in college and later on various hackathons & projects. He is a resourceful person and has great passion towards solving problems with logical and analytical thinking.He managed & fetched lucrative sponsorships for numerous college events.Moreover, his command on python and Machine Learning techniques has been a major asset for us while working on hackathons and projects. His ability to drive the team towards the deliverables makes him a great team player. He's not afraid to take risks and often suggests new directions to explore.Akshay has my highest recommendation for any future Data Science position he takes up. Im excited to see the direction in which the organization will grow under his Data Science skills & leadership."

I was unsure of the skills required and how to perform effectively in my role as a product manager leading a scrum team. Upon starting the job, Richard was one of the best role models I could have asked for. I was able to develop and learn thanks to the support that Richard provided and his constant striving for improvement in our processes and dynamic was utterly invaluable to my personal and professional development. Richard is an incredible scrum master, with expertise in software delivery, lean agile methodologies, stakeholder engagement and allowing for product development to be effectively run under extremely pressured environments. I had one of the best experiences of my career working with Richard, and have nothing but praise for him and the work he has done in our team. Adnan Ud-DinLead User Researcher at Ofsted (Contract)   John was senior to Adnan but didnt manage directlyI first started working with Adnan on the CDS exports programme, and I was immediately struck by his diligence, professionalism and dedication to providing high-quality user research to the team as a whole. The work Adnan produced was invaluable to the wider CDS project, giving real insight into how users want their experience to be. It was a pleasure working with Adnan, and I would wholeheartedly work alongside such a talented, funny and diligent individual again. "
